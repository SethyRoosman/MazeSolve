# MazeSolve
## My ultimate goal with this project is to implement several different algorithms for solving the supplied maze
###  Recursion-based : Currently working on this solve implementation
###  Binary-search tree : Possibly next solve implementation
###  Flood-fill algorithm : Possibly next solve implementation
